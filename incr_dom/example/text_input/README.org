A simple example of using a text input in incr_dom.

This example illustrates how to keep track of and modify the content
of a text input using the incr_dom model instead of solely relying on
the browser to do the state management.

This approach makes dynamic uses of forms more reliable, since it
gives you more control over the content of each input.
