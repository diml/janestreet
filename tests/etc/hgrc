# This hgrc file is used by the hg invocations fired off during the
# functional testing of Iron.  The functional-testing framework sets
# $HGRCPATH to *just this* file, to lock down the dependency and make
# tests repeatable.  Bottom line: put stuff here that needs to be used
# when the tests run.

# This hgrc is just for the calls to hg that appear in *.t scripts; Iron
# internally still uses its own hgrc.
