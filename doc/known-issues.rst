mli only modules
================

These are supported, however using them might cause make it impossible for
non-jbuilder users to use your library. We tried to use them for some internal
module generated by Jbuilder and it broke the build of projects not using
Jbuilder:

So, while they are supported, you should be careful where you use them. Using a
`.ml` only module is still preferable.
