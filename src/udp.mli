(* provides an interface to UDP socket setup and teardown that automatically handles
  many of the details.  Most importantly:

  - addresses will be looked up and/or converted from string representations automagically
  - sockets will be closed when possible on error conditions
  - unlike the low level unix functions these collect errors and throw them as exceptions
*)

a unix domain socket, listening on a path indicated by addr.  When  clients
connect f will be run and is passed the address of the client, and a Reader and
Writer for communicating with the client. When the deferred returned by f is
determined or f throws an exception the client socket and the reader and writer
will be closed.  The Deferred returned by the function as a whole will be
determined when the server is ready to accept incoming connections *)
